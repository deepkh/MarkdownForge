# AGENTS.md

## Project

LocalDraftAI is a local-first, browser-based Markdown-first text editor with Markdown WYSIWYG/source editing, source-only plain text and structured files, Soft Wrap, local file access, image asset handling, multi-tab sessions, validation warnings, and AI-assisted writing actions.

The app is currently a dependency-free static HTML/CSS/JavaScript project. Preserve that structure unless the user explicitly asks for a build system or new dependencies.

## Core Rules

- Keep the app local-first and usable without an AI server.
- Keep Markdown as the source of truth.
- Keep changes small, readable, and easy to review.
- Do not add dependencies unless requested.
- Do not rewrite unrelated code.
- Ask before destructive actions, deleting files, or rewriting git history.
- Ask before reading or writing outside this repo or `/tmp`.
- It is OK to run normal inspection, edit, and test commands inside this repo.

## Behavior Notes

- Each open document tab owns its own title, dirty state, active mode, scroll state, undo/redo history, file handle, workspace folder, and image object URLs.
- Every document session has a provider ID, normalized storage resource, and revision. Legacy local file and workspace handles remain compatibility fields; provider-neutral application code uses storage resources.
- Local File System Access picker, read, write, directory traversal, and workspace mutation calls belong in `local-filesystem-provider.js`. Local asset storage may retain narrowly scoped browser file calls in `asset-store.js`.
- The optional Go bridge binds to loopback by default but supports explicit non-loopback listeners, serves only `src/` and `assets/` over TLS, writes its complete one-time administrator URL once to stdout without launching a browser, and has no plaintext HTTP/WS listener.
- The bridge binary workflow runs Go tests and vet before CGO-disabled Linux x86-64, Linux AArch64, and Windows x64 cross-builds. Version tags publish all three binaries with SHA-256 checksums; binaries continue to require an explicit LocalDraftAI static `--web-root`.
- Bridge JSON-RPC protocol version 2 requires paired ECDSA P-256 browser authentication before ordinary RPCs and limits messages to 16 MB, concurrent calls to 8, normal operations to 30 seconds, search to 120 seconds, and its redacted in-memory log to 200 structured entries.
- Bridge connection profiles are stored atomically without secrets. SSH authentication tries the agent before a configured identity and uses prompt-scoped passphrases or passwords only in process memory. Unknown host keys require fingerprint confirmation in the bridge-managed `known_hosts`; changed keys are blocked.
- OpenSSH discovery supports exact host aliases and only `Host`, `HostName`, `User`, `Port`, `IdentityFile`, `IdentitiesOnly`, and `UserKnownHostsFile`. Do not write OpenSSH configuration or user-managed known-host files, and do not imply support for deferred proxy, forwarding, certificate, PKCS#11, or connection-sharing options.
- Connected SSH sessions own an SFTP client, use a 15-second connection timeout and a 30-second keepalive, and close after three consecutive keepalive failures. Remote shell commands remain out of scope.
- The static app resolves a bridge from an explicit stored WSS endpoint first, then same-origin `/api/health`, and otherwise remains unconfigured. A hosted site with no endpoint does not probe loopback.
- Bridge admission requires TLS, an exact configured public Host, an exact built-in or configured HTTPS frontend Origin, and paired browser-key authentication. The bridge's own origin plus a valid Secure HttpOnly strict-same-site admin cookie adds administrator claims; cross-origin paired clients never receive them.
- Allowed origins and paired public keys are stored atomically in `bridge-settings.json` and `paired-clients.json`. Browser private keys are non-exportable and persist only as IndexedDB `CryptoKey` objects. Removing an origin or revoking a client closes affected authenticated sockets.
- The Remote Status Bar item always identifies local or SSH state. SSH commands are enabled only after an authenticated WSS bridge handshake from either the bridge-served or a configured hosted frontend.
- Remote connection UI owns profile management, host-key confirmation, prompt-scoped password/passphrase entry, remote folder selection, and the redacted connection log. Clear secret inputs before requests settle, never use browser storage for them, and do not switch workspaces until the selected folder opens successfully.
- A bridge-served Remote SSH workspace uses `remote-ssh`, opens only after SFTP canonicalizes its absolute root, and passes only workspace-relative POSIX paths after opening. Existing targets must resolve at or below the canonical root; reject absolute, dot, dot-dot, Windows, UNC, root-prefix, and symlink-escape paths.
- Local Explorer trees are eager and omit directories without registered supported-document descendants. A directory created through Explorer may be preserved in memory for the current workspace session until it gains a supported descendant or the workspace changes.
- Remote Explorer trees are lazy: open lists only the root, expansion loads one directory through the provider, unsupported files stay hidden through `document-type.js`, unloaded directory nodes remain visible because their contents are unknown, and a directory error stays attached to that node.
- Do not recursively scan Remote SSH workspaces merely to determine Explorer folder visibility.
- Remote text writes carry the opened SHA-256 revision, replace through a same-directory temporary file, preserve the prior mode when possible, and verify the final bytes before success. A mismatched revision returns `REVISION_CONFLICT` without modifying the target.
- Remote Save As, New File, New Folder, Rename, and Duplicate stay inside the active workspace provider and refresh only their affected lazy Explorer directory. They must never invoke local browser file APIs. Delete remains out of scope.
- Remote revision conflicts keep the editor dirty and offer Compare Changes, Reload Remote with dirty confirmation, explicit forced Overwrite, and Cancel. Compare is the default action and uses the shared text diff renderer without entering AI review state.
- SSH connection loss must preserve tabs, dirty buffers, selections, scroll, mode, and Soft Wrap while disabling remote filesystem actions. Keepalive loss permits at most three automatic reconnect attempts with approximately 1, 2, and 4 second delays; Disconnect cancels them and authentication failures are not retried automatically.
- After reconnect, revalidate all open remote resources by SHA-256 without replacing editor content. Update unchanged revisions, mark changed or missing resources, and retain the old expected revision so a later Save conflicts unless the user explicitly overwrites.
- Remote session metadata uses IndexedDB version 3 with a connection ID and canonical root but no document content or secrets. Restore only after explicit user action, reconnect through the saved profile, reread tabs, preserve lightweight editor/sidebar state, and report missing profiles, roots, and files visibly.
- Remote Search is a bridge-side SFTP traversal over registered text extensions, not a loaded-node browser search or remote shell command. Enforce 500 results, 20,000 visited files, 10 MB per file, request timeout/cancellation, and visible truncation or warning counts; Search results may open unloaded paths through provider `stat` and `readText`.
- Remote Related results use loaded same-folder nodes, workspace-scoped recent identities, and provider `stat` for unresolved Markdown links. Do not recursively download a remote workspace for Related or plan discovery.
- Remote image reads and writes use authenticated, workspace-scoped, chunked binary RPC. Accept only PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF through content and extension checks, enforce the 25 MB limit, reject path/symlink escapes, and never provide a local asset fallback.
- Remote Markdown image object URLs belong to their document session and must be revoked on close or reload. Paste/drop creates or reuses the remote root `assets/` folder, selects a safe unique name, inserts a document-relative Markdown link, and refreshes the lazy Explorer metadata.
- The left workspace sidebar lists registered text documents (`.md`, `.markdown`, `.txt`, `.log`, `.json`, `.yml`, and `.yaml`), keeps unsupported files hidden, and opens supported workspace files in tabs.
- Every supported extension and its editor, validation, formatting, and AI capabilities must be registered centrally in `document-type.js`; do not duplicate extension regular expressions across modules.
- Markdown behavior must remain backward compatible. Only Markdown may enter Markdown-to-HTML or HTML-to-Markdown conversion, use WYSIWYG, or run Markdown formatting commands.
- JSON and YAML remain source-only, are never automatically reformatted, and show warning-only validation. Invalid structured documents must remain editable and saveable.
- The workspace sidebar supports expanded, minimized, and hidden modes, persists its mode and width in localStorage, supports Files, Search, and Related views, and lets folders in the Files tree collapse or expand with workspace-relative persisted state. Keep Minimize Sidebar in the View menu rather than the Explorer panel header.
- Opening a workspace file or selecting its document tab reveals and scrolls its Explorer row into view. Keep the reveal pending while Search, Related, hidden, or minimized modes are active, and apply it when Files is visible without switching the user's active primary view.
- Workspace session restore uses IndexedDB schema version 3 for provider-aware workspace references, up to 10 recent workspace records, lightweight opened-tab metadata, workspace-relative collapsed folder paths, and sidebar scroll position. Version-2 `workspaceHandle` records normalize to `local-fsa` records indefinitely. Restore remains an explicit user action and normal restore must not store full document contents.
- Switching to a different workspace removes supported workspace tabs owned by the previous workspace from the tab bar while preserving lightweight restore metadata for that workspace. If any of those tabs are dirty, the user must confirm before the switch completes.
- Close All Open Files in the Workspace menu closes every current tab after one aggregate dirty-state confirmation and resets the editor to a fresh Untitled Markdown tab. Closing the active workspace uses the same behavior for all tabs, including tabs not owned by that workspace.
- Workspace file operations must stay safe: New File, New Folder, Duplicate, Copy Relative Path, and conservative Rename are allowed for registered document types; Delete is out of scope.
- Workspace content search scans all registered text-document types and should cap matches to avoid runaway UI work.
- Related files are simple rule-based context only: every supported type gets same-folder and recently opened files; Markdown alone gets Markdown links and plan files. Do not add embeddings or AI context execution here.
- Plan badges use simple filename/path rules and must not imply any agent execution feature.
- WYSIWYG mode supports safe rich HTML paste through one shared sanitizer for native and context-menu paste. Markdown-compatible formatting is preserved, redundant layout containers around document blocks are unwrapped, and webpage controls, executable or embedded content, media widgets, SVG UI, unsafe attributes, inline styles, and event handlers are removed with blocked subtree content.
- WYSIWYG H1, H2, and H3 headings use compact 24px, 20px, and 18px document typography at weight 600 so pasted heading hierarchy remains visually consistent.
- The editor right-click menu should include Cut, Copy, and Paste; Markdown mode uses plain text, while WYSIWYG mode should preserve rich HTML clipboard data when the browser allows it.
- Markdown mode should accept plain Markdown text.
- Markdown rendering and toolbar actions support basic blocks including headings, lists, block quotes, code fences, images, links, horizontal rules, and pipe tables.
- Escaped Markdown punctuation should render and round-trip as literal text in WYSIWYG mode.
- LocalDraftAI uses one main editor surface.
- The application shell uses semantic Menu Bar, Activity Bar, Primary Sidebar, Editor Area, Secondary Sidebar, and Status Bar regions.
- The Activity Bar is the sole switcher and hide/show control for Explorer, Search, and Related in the existing workspace sidebar; do not add an internal panel header, duplicate those view buttons, or add a hide button inside the sidebar. It also opens the AI Secondary Sidebar without moving review state. AI provider settings remain available inside the AI Assistant panel.
- Theme is application-level state with supported `light` and `dark` values stored under `localdraftai.appearance.theme` in localStorage.
- Apply the persisted theme before the stylesheet renders; switching themes must not modify document, editor, tab, sidebar, workspace, or AI state.
- Theme-sensitive colors belong in semantic CSS variables with light defaults and dark overrides.
- The command registry maps Menu Bar commands to existing app behavior; menu modules must not reimplement file, editor, workspace, or AI operations.
- The Status Bar displays workspace, unsaved-document, editor mode, Soft Wrap, Markdown cursor, word count, and AI provider state passed from their existing owners.
- Only one editor mode is visible at a time: WYSIWYG or source. WYSIWYG is available only to Markdown documents.
- WYSIWYG remains the editable rendered view.
- Markdown remains the source of truth for saving and syncing.
- Soft Wrap affects visual wrapping only and must not change saved document content in any supported type.
- Application actions remain available from the compact Menu Bar. The Editor Area topbar keeps tabs, Format, Markdown/WYSIWYG, and document More visible while formatting expands into an optional second row; the AI Assistant is opened from the Activity Bar or application menu.
- Formatting-toolbar preference is stored under `localdraftai.ui.formatToolbarVisible`, defaults to collapsed, and is not overwritten when Focus Mode or a source-only document temporarily hides the row.
- Topbar popup commands execute through the command registry, while formatting `data-action` controls continue through the existing editor-action delegate and must execute exactly once.
- The right-hand workspace hosts the AI Assistant review panel and should keep the editor visible while reviewing output.
- The AI Assistant review panel is manually resizable on wide desktop layouts, stores its width in localStorage, and should clamp against the workspace sidebar so the editor remains usable.
- AI actions should operate on selected text and show review UI before applying changes; keep the modal path available as a fallback while the panel experiment stabilizes.
- AI action menus are generated from validated local YAML. Invalid YAML must not replace the current or last-good config.
- AI capture should send selected content as Markdown fragments in both WYSIWYG and Markdown modes; WYSIWYG list selections should preserve Markdown list markers.
- AI review should keep AI Result - AI can make mistakes editable and refresh the visual diff when it changes.
- AI review should show the AI Engine summary for the provider, model, and reasoning settings that generated the currently visible result.
- AI review Advanced overrides should be temporary to the current action and should only add a new revision after Regenerate Result succeeds.
- AI review should keep generated results as in-memory revisions for the current action; do not persist revision history unless explicitly requested.
- AI interactive review should keep accept/reject choices in review state and apply only after the final apply click.
- AI apply mode should support replacing the selection, inserting below the selection, or copying the result without changing the document.
- Plain text may use general writing AI actions, but Markdown-only actions must be hidden. JSON and YAML replacement-based AI actions remain disabled.
- AI Restore Original should use exact range or safe text-match restoration and show a clear message instead of guessing when restore is unsafe.
- AI provider mode should support local mock mode, native Ollama, OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, Mistral, Claude, Grok, and OpenAI-compatible custom server mode.
- AI reasoning mode should support Auto, Off, Low, Medium, High, and Extra High, map them to provider-supported reasoning controls, and only show provider-returned summaries when requested.
- AI errors should be visible and recoverable, not silent.
- The feedback hint should link to the GitHub issues page.
