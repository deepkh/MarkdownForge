# LocalDraft Bridge

`localdraft-bridge` provides the loopback-only native boundary for optional Remote SSH Workspaces.

```text
LocalDraftAI browser UI
  -> authenticated same-origin JSON-RPC WebSocket
  -> localdraft-bridge on 127.0.0.1
  -> SSH connection
  -> SFTP subsystem
  -> remote workspace root
```

The bridge serves the unchanged static frontend, keeps SSH credentials and host verification out of the browser, and exposes only workspace-scoped filesystem operations. No component is installed on the remote host; it needs only OpenSSH, SFTP, and a permitted user account.

## Current bridge surface

- `GET /api/health` returns bridge and protocol versions.
- `GET /api/session?token=...` exchanges the one-time startup token for an HttpOnly, `SameSite=Strict` cookie and redirects to the app.
- `/api/bridge` accepts authenticated, exact-origin JSON-RPC 2.0 WebSockets.
- `/src/` and `/assets/` serve only the repository's static app files. `/` and `/index.html` redirect to the app shell.
- `bridge.hello`, `bridge.getStatus`, and `bridge.getLogs` are available at protocol version 1.
- Profile RPCs list, create, update, and remove saved connections and discover supported aliases from `~/.ssh/config`.
- Connection RPCs connect, answer one-time host-key or secret prompts, disconnect, reconnect, inspect status, and browse absolute remote directories for folder selection.
- Successful SSH authentication starts an SFTP client; no remote shell or LocalDraftAI remote agent is used.
- Workspace RPCs open, close, and inspect a canonical SFTP workspace root. Filesystem RPCs list, stat, read, conditionally write, create, rename, duplicate, search, and transfer supported binary images through workspace IDs and relative POSIX paths.

The server limits WebSocket JSON messages to 16 MB, concurrent RPC calls to 8, normal calls to 30 seconds, and search calls to 120 seconds. Directory listings are limited to 5,000 entries, text reads to 10 MB, and binary images to 25 MB; binary data is transferred in 4 MB chunks. Limit violations return structured errors rather than partial content. Its structured in-memory log is bounded to 200 entries and never records request bodies, cookies, startup tokens, secrets, or document contents.

## Build and launch

Go 1.25 or newer is required.

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd bridge
go test ./...
go vet ./...
go build -o ../build/localdraft-bridge ./cmd/localdraft-bridge
cd ..
./build/localdraft-bridge serve --listen 127.0.0.1:4782 --web-root .
```

## GitHub binary builds

The `Build bridge binaries` GitHub Actions workflow tests and vets the bridge before cross-compiling these artifacts:

```text
localdraft-bridge-linux-x86_64
localdraft-bridge-linux-aarch64
localdraft-bridge-windows-x64.exe
```

The workflow runs for bridge changes on `master`, relevant pull requests, version tags matching `v*`, and manual dispatches. Workflow artifacts are retained for 30 days. A version tag also creates a GitHub Release with the three binaries and `SHA256SUMS.txt`.

The binary does not embed the static frontend. Keep it beside or point it at a LocalDraftAI checkout, then provide the checkout root with `--web-root`:

```bash
chmod +x localdraft-bridge-linux-x86_64
./localdraft-bridge-linux-x86_64 serve --web-root /path/to/LocalDraftAI
```

On Windows:

```powershell
.\localdraft-bridge-windows-x64.exe serve --web-root C:\path\to\LocalDraftAI
```

Development options:

```text
--config-dir <path>
--log-level debug|info|warn|error
--unsafe-non-loopback
```

The default listener is `127.0.0.1:4782`. A non-loopback listener is rejected unless `--unsafe-non-loopback` is explicitly supplied; that flag is for isolated development only and is not a supported deployment mode.

At startup, the bridge writes the complete one-time session URL to stdout. It never launches a browser. Copy and open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4782/api/session?token=<SESSION_TOKEN>
```

The process output contract is:

```text
stdout: one-time session URL
stderr: bridge logs and diagnostics
```

The URL contains a cryptographically random token that is invalidated after its first successful exchange. It is not added to the bridge's structured in-memory log, written to configuration, or stored in browser storage, but the URL may be captured by any process supervising stdout. The URL grants a browser session to the local bridge until its token is successfully consumed. Do not share it or store it in configuration.

The successful exchange sets the browser session cookie and redirects to `/src/local_draft_ai.html`. The WebSocket rejects missing sessions, missing origins, public origins, and any origin whose host and port do not exactly match the bridge.

## SSH configuration and trust

The bridge stores connection profiles and its own host-key database under the platform user configuration directory:

```text
<user-config-dir>/LocalDraftAI/connections.json
<user-config-dir>/LocalDraftAI/known_hosts
```

`os.UserConfigDir()` selects the base directory: normally `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `$HOME/.config` on Linux, `$HOME/Library/Application Support` on macOS, and `%AppData%` on Windows. `--config-dir` replaces that base for development or portable testing.

Profiles contain host, port, user, authentication preferences, an optional identity-file path, and an optional default folder. They never contain passwords, passphrases, or private-key contents. Profile writes are atomic and use restrictive permissions where the platform supports them.

The connection manager tries the SSH agent, then the configured identity file, then a session-only passphrase for an encrypted identity, and finally a session-only password when allowed. Secrets are bound to a single prompt and discarded after the attempt. Connections use a 15-second timeout and a 30-second keepalive. After three consecutive keepalive failures, the bridge closes the failed clients and makes at most three retryable reconnect attempts after approximately 1, 2, and 4 seconds. Explicit Disconnect cancels the retry loop, and authentication or host-key failures are not retried automatically.

Exact aliases from `~/.ssh/config` may supply `Host`, `HostName`, `User`, `Port`, `IdentityFile`, `IdentitiesOnly`, and `UserKnownHostsFile`. Wildcard hosts and unsupported features such as `Match`, `ProxyJump`, `ProxyCommand`, forwarding, certificates, PKCS#11, and connection sharing are not imported. The bridge never writes to the user's OpenSSH configuration or existing known-host files.

An unknown host key must be confirmed by fingerprint before it is appended to the bridge-managed `known_hosts`. A changed key is blocked and reports both expected and received fingerprints; it is never replaced automatically.

To recover from an intentionally changed host key, disconnect and stop the bridge first, then independently verify the server's new fingerprint with its administrator or console. Back up the bridge-managed `known_hosts` and remove only that host's old entry with OpenSSH tooling:

```bash
ssh-keygen -R "hostname" -f "<user-config-dir>/LocalDraftAI/known_hosts"
# For a non-default port, use:
ssh-keygen -R "[hostname]:2222" -f "<user-config-dir>/LocalDraftAI/known_hosts"
```

Restart the bridge and compare the newly displayed fingerprint before choosing Trust and Continue. If an imported profile points at a separate `UserKnownHostsFile`, update that user-managed file through your normal SSH administration process as well; LocalDraftAI never edits it.

## Remote workspaces

`workspace.open` resolves the selected absolute folder through SFTP and stores its canonical path in bridge memory. Subsequent filesystem calls reject absolute paths, dot components, Windows or UNC paths, and any existing target whose resolved path escapes the workspace through a symlink or root-prefix ambiguity. The bridge uses SFTP APIs only; it never constructs remote shell commands.

Remote Explorer listings contain directories and regular files with metadata. The frontend filters supported document types through its central registry and loads directories lazily. `fs.readText` stats before reading, rejects files over 10 MB, reads bounded exact UTF-8 bytes without changing a BOM, line endings, or final newline, then returns size, modification time, and a SHA-256 hash.

`fs.writeText` hashes the current bytes and compares them with the expected revision before changing anything. It writes exact serialized bytes into an exclusive same-directory temporary file, retains the destination mode when possible, uses the SFTP POSIX rename extension when available, and otherwise uses backup, replacement, and rollback renames. The bridge rereads and verifies the final target before returning its new revision. Create operations reserve destinations exclusively; rename rejects existing targets; duplicate preserves exact bytes and chooses a numbered name when needed.

Remote Save, Save As, New File, New Folder, Rename, and Duplicate are enabled only through the authenticated provider. Revision conflicts never change the target and the frontend offers text comparison, confirmed reload, explicit forced overwrite, or cancel. A disconnected workspace keeps browser editor state in memory while remote operations are unavailable. After reconnect, the frontend verifies the workspace and rereads authoritative revisions for open resources; changed or missing files stay marked with their prior expected revision to prevent silent overwrite.

`fs.searchText` traverses through SFTP without invoking a shell. It scans only the LocalDraftAI text extensions, skips files over 10 MB plus unreadable or invalid UTF-8 files, checks request cancellation, visits at most 20,000 regular files, and returns at most 500 matches with truncation, visit, and warning metadata. Remote restore remains browser-orchestrated: after explicit user action the browser reconnects a saved profile, calls `workspace.open`, and rereads saved tab paths; the bridge never stores document contents. Related link checks use workspace-scoped `fs.stat` calls without recursive discovery.

`fs.readBinary` and `fs.writeBinary` accept only PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF files whose detected content matches the filename extension. They apply the same canonical-root, parent, and symlink guards as text operations and reject assets above 25 MB. The JSON-RPC layer transfers at most 4 MB of raw binary data per base64 chunk, bounds incomplete uploads to eight in-memory assemblies, expires abandoned assemblies, and atomically writes and verifies only the completed image. The browser creates authenticated per-tab object URLs; the bridge exposes no arbitrary-path image HTTP endpoint. The hosted `https://localdraft.ai/` app remains local-only and does not probe a loopback bridge.

## Release limitations

- Remote mode runs only from the bridge-served loopback origin; the hosted site remains local-file editing only.
- One workspace provider and one remote host are active per application window; mixed local/remote workspace tabs are not supported.
- There is no terminal, remote command execution, Git UI, debugger, language server, remote extension, port forwarding, `ProxyJump`, or `ProxyCommand` support.
- Remote delete, symlink creation, offline synchronization, mirror folders, persistent dirty-buffer recovery, and Windows-style remote roots are not implemented.
- OpenSSH import is limited to the options listed above. Remote hosts need an OpenSSH-compatible SSH server, SFTP, and the account's existing filesystem permissions.
- Remote assets are limited to PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF and 25 MB per image. Text files remain limited to 10 MB.
